# MLADS Conference
## Deploying a Predictive Maintenance Cortana Intelligence Suite Solution Template

### Session Goals
1. Understand how the Cortana Intelligence Suite can be utilized to build end to end solutions, with predictive maintenance as the example use case
2. Learn about the underlying technologies in a hands-on manner with associated material for deep dive study

### Prerequisites

1. Bring your computer
2. Have Power BI Desktop already installed: https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/
3. Need Power BI account for publishing a dashboard (all Microsoft employees should have this, verify by going to https://msit.powerbi.com/ )
4. Need an Azure subscription with available resources (can use your MSDN or another subscription, can double check you have resources available by doing the 1-click deployment from https://gallery.cortanaanalytics.com/SolutionTemplate/Predictive-Maintenance-for-Aerospace-1 and making sure you donâ€™t have errors rising from not enough resources such as SQL Server limit, etc.)

### Outline
1. Brief introduction of predictive maintenance (15 min)
2. Deploying CAS solution template (hands-on walkthrough) (90 min total)
3. Tips & Tricks to creating end to end solutions, Links to materials for deep dive study (10 min)

## Directions
1. Sign into the Azure portal (likely 2-factor authentication) at portal.azure.com
2. Go to Gallery page for the solution template https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/SolutionTemplate/Predictive-Maintenance-for-Aerospace-1 and click on "Deploy"
3. Usually takes ~20 minutes to deploy. Continue checking on it. If there is an error, try deleting the template and doing it again. If you get an error again, it might be due to resource constraints in your Azure portal. Ask a TA in the class for help.
4. Follow along with the instructor or use the technical guide to set up the rest of the pieces: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/cortana-analytics-technical-guide-predictive-maintenance/#strongmonitor-progressstrong
